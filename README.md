# Discord Bot Manager for Linux

This bot manager for Linux runs in Termux and on Ubuntu/Debian.  You don't need to install any packages, the program does that itself.  It uses GUI for use, so with Termux make sure you have VNC set up

## How you can use it

Install git

by Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```
by Termux:
```bash
pkg install git
```
Clone the Repository with:
```bash
git clone
